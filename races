    "Altmer": {
        "Brief": "The Altmer (also known as high elves) are a tall, golden-skinned race, hailing from Summerset Isle. Known for being proud and snobbish, other races generally resent them. Altmer consider themselves to be the most civilized culture of Tamriel; the common tongue of the continent is based on Altmer speech and writing, and most of the Empire's arts, crafts, laws, and sciences are derived from Altmer traditions.",
        "Summary": "The Altmer are the most strongly gifted in the arcane arts. They are among the longest living and intelligent races of Tamriel, and they often become powerful magic users due to both their magical affinity and the many years they may devote to their studies.<br><br>On average, Altmer are of smaller build than humans, and thus generally not as strong. Their tall stature also makes them less agile than their Bosmeri cousins. However, Altmer are among the most intelligent and magically-inclined races on Nirn, surpassing even the Bretons in magical aptitude.",
        "Basics": "        <b>Age.</b>The average Altmer can live for over 400 years, although they are known to be able to live for thousands of years. It is rumored that some Altmer on the Summerset Isles are over 4000 years old. They reach puberty at 18 years old and are considered an adult at 30. They mature similar to humans, but their advanced age means that they are still considered young until the age of 60.<br><br>               Size.</b> High Elves are the tallest of the races of Tamriel, sometimes as tall as 7 feet, but they often have slender, thin builds. Your size is Medium.<br><br>                Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.",

        "Brief": "Argonians, also known as People of the Root, or Saxhleel in their native tongue of Jel, are the reptilian natives of the swampland known as the Black Marsh.

        "Summary": "They are known as the foremost experts in guerrilla warfare throughout the Starry Heart, a reputation brought upon them by defending their borders from enemies for countless centuries. Argonians have a lifespan similar to that of humans. According to the First Era Scholar Brendan the Persistent “the Argonian people have, throughout Tamrielic history, been perhaps the most misunderstood, vilified, and reviled of all the sentient races. Yet, those who have taken the time to experience Argonian culture have gained a greater appreciation for this noble and beautiful people. However, it should be noted that he himself went missing in his final expedition into the deeper swamps of their homeland.<br><br>Outside of the Black Marsh, little is known of their homeland or native culture, and their alien physiology and customs are not well understood by scholars. They have been perhaps the most misunderstood of all the intelligent races.",

The Khajiit, along with the Argonians and theImga, make up the so called 'beast races' of the Empire, due to their anthropomorphic qualities. Khajiit have a lifespan similar to that of humans. It is currently unclear whether a successful union between Khajiit and other races may occur, for no well-documented cases exist despite rumors. The divergent appearance and mannerisms of the Khajiit often lead bigoted members of other races to look down on them.",

        "Traits": {
            "Quick Claws": "Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
