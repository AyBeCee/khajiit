    "Khajiit": {
        "Brief": "The Khajiit are feline humanoids hailing from the province of Elsweyr, well-known for their keen intelligence and agility. While these traits make them superb thieves and acrobats, Khajiit are also fearsome warriors. However, strenuous training must typically be undertaken to make wielding magic a serious option, either in passive or aggressive actions. Khajiit are said to rarely take to the sea, though piracy and the skooma trade does draw some to work as sailors.",
        "Summary": "Physiologically, Khajiit differ greatly from both the varied races of man and mer, not only in their skeletal structure (possessing a tail and, in some forms, a digitigrade stance, i.e. toe walking) and dermal makeup (the 'fur' that covers their bodies) but in their digestion and metabolism as well. The Khajiit, along with the Argonians and theImga, make up the so called 'beast races' of the Empire, due to their anthropomorphic qualities. Khajiit have a lifespan similar to that of humans. It is currently unclear whether a successful union between Khajiit and other races may occur, for no well-documented cases exist despite rumors. The divergent appearance and mannerisms of the Khajiit often lead bigoted members of other races to look down on them.",

        "Traits": {
            "Quick Claws": "Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

        "Subrace summary": "There are many subraces of the Khajiit. Many of the subraces are humanoid in shape, but there are others, such as the Alfiq, that more resemble a house cat, or the senche, which are tiger-like battle cats.",

                    "Ohmes Combat Training": "The Ohmes do not have natural claws, like other Khajiit, so they don't benefit from the Quick Claws trait, but they are still proficient in Hand-to-Hand and Short Blade to make up for their natural handicap."
