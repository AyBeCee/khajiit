Surprise attacks against the character when he’s at rest suffer no such penalties. These penalties are relative and only work in one direction. Faster characters ignore the penalties of everyone of equal speed or below. Slower characters use the difference between their penalty and their target (so a hero at Pace 48 has a –6 penalty to hit a foe moving at Super Sonic Speed rather than the standard –8).

        "Description": "A rare few individuals don’t let even the cold hand of death stop them. These are undead—vampires, zombies, liches, spiteful revenants from beyond the grave, and more. The specifics of your cadavers’ abilities depend on his exact “species,” but all undead have a few things in common. Undead gain +2 to their Toughness, add +2 to recover from being Shaken, don’t breathe, are immune to disease and poison, and don’t suffer additional damage from called shots. Undead Wild Cards also ignore one point of wound penalties. Undead don’t benefit from the Healing skill, but roll natural healing rolls once per day. They suffer –2 Charisma in close contact due to their clammy skin and dark aura. (If your undead is decayed, take the Ugly Hindrance.) Undead who are forced to roll on the Knockout Blow Table do not Bleed Out or suffer permanent injuries—they’re merely Incapacitated until healed. They may still die (again), however, and use the Death & Defeat rules normally."

Conjuring it takes one full round (two if indoors), and no other actions are allowed. Anyone touched by the whirlwind must make a Strength roll or be Knocked Prone. If his Strength die is a 1 he is also Shaken.",
